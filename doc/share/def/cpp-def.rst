.. define-macro:: cpp-compilers project

	$project is written in C++, so obviously you will need a C++ compiler and standard C/C++ libraries. The latest version of $project was tested on:

	* Windows
		- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
		- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
		- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015

	* Linux
		- GCC++ version 4.8.4
		- Clang++ version 3.5.0

	* Mac OS X
		- Clang++ version 7.3.0

	The above version numbers are provided for reference only. If the version of C++ compiler on your machine is higher or not too much lower, don't worry -- it will most likely compile $project just fine.
